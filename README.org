* Intro / Demo
  Electricity is dangerous and deadly be sure you know what you're doing.
* Meatspace stuff
 + Raspberry pi
 + Sensors
   - Dallas one-wire
   - SPI
   - I2C
 + Parts
   - Breadboard
   - Wire
   - Adafruit Assembled Pi Cobbler Breakout + Cable
   - Resistors
 + Networks
   - Cat 5
   - Zigbee
 + Tools
   - Cat 5
   - RJ-45 ends
   - RJ-45 sockets
   - Punch-down tool
   - Crimper

* Software
 + http://www.raspbian.org
 + build-essential for building binary npm packages
 + avahi-daemon for finding raspberrypi on the network
 + NodeJs http://nodejs.org/dist/
   - Builds for Pi are sporadic. Search releases for node-v0.10.24-linux- *arm* -pi.tar.gz
 + Favorite development tools
*** Kernel modules
    sudo modprobe w1-gpio
    sudo modprobe w1-therm

* Gotchas
  I roached my first SD card. You only get 10K writes on a SD card, those writes go can go quickly with sqlite.
   - Still working on a good compromise. 
* Double duties for raspberrypi
 + Airplay target
 + Wireless print server
 + XBMC
* Outro
